    """Persistent pose-estimation channel for realtime tracking.

    Phase 2 of the live skeleton optimization. The mobile client opens
    one WebSocket per exercise, streams raw JPEG frames as binary
    messages, and receives JSON pose results. Eliminates ~80-150ms of
    per-frame HTTP + base64 overhead that the /pose/estimate path pays.

    Protocol:
      1. Client connects to /ws/pose (no query params).
      2. Server accepts the upgrade.
      3. Client sends an auth JSON message:
            {"type": "auth", "token": "<jwt>",
             "exercise_type": "...", "affected_side": "left|right|both",
             "session_id": "<session key>", "exercise_slug": "..."}
         When session_id is present the backend records a short evidence
         clip from this stream (core/session_video). The patient_id it
         files the clip under comes from the VERIFIED token subject, not
         any client-supplied field.
      4. Server validates JWT (within _WS_AUTH_TIMEOUT_SECONDS) and
         replies {"type": "auth_ok"}. On failure: close 4401.
      5. Client streams JPEG bytes as binary frames; server replies
         with one JSON pose result per frame (always — even on decode
         failures we send an error payload so the client's
         backpressure loop never stalls on a dropped frame).

    Why first-message auth instead of ?token= in the URL: the URL ends
    up in reverse-proxy logs, error traces, and any other place that
    records request URLs, which would leak the bearer token. The
    handshake-message approach keeps the JWT in the message body where
    standard secret-scrubbing applies.

    `exercise_type` and `affected_side` are locked for the life of the
    connection. Switching exercises closes + reopens the socket — the
    frontend already remounts CameraComponent per exercise via
    key=exercise.id so the close happens automatically.

    Each connection owns its own MediaPipe Pose instance via
    create_realtime_pose(). That isolates per-frame tracking + landmark
    smoothing state so one patient's last frame never affects another
    patient's first frame.
